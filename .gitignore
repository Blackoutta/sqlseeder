# pyenv
# For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; you should adapt this list as necessary.
# For an application, these files can be committed so that users can recreate the environment
# and ensure they have the same setup.
# .python-version

# pipenv
# According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
# However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
# having different versions installed, this file should be included in .gitignore.
# Pipfile.lock
